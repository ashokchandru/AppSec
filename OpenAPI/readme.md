## What is OpenAPI
<a href="https://github.com/OAI/openAPI-specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAPI</a> 
> OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines standard interface document for HTTP APIs, which which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface documentation have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.
